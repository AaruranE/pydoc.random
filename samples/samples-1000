The first line of the Formatter class shows the line number of
the first line of the header.  The second line of the Formatter class
indicates the number of the first line of the header.
The header is not displayed unless the field is set to a , and
the field is a dictionary of strings.



The first line of Formatter class is defined by
Formatter.setfield(value, type)
If type is a sequence of
strings that contains a field named value, the field is
modified by the setfield() method.  If type is a single
string, the field is modified by the setfield() method.  For example:
>>> class _Field:
...     'fieldname' = '__class__'
...     'value' = 2


This class is documented in section Field objects.

The field syntax is detailed in the section Field Objects.
