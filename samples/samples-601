 supported the
command.  The result will always be True if you passed
a command argument.



command.aisok()
Return True if the argument was actually defined by the
command; otherwise return False.  If true, the
command is defined with no arguments, and therefore there
is no need to define a new command with arguments.
This function is implemented by the standard library’s
command family interface.  This is the recommended form of
command with the same name.

Changed in version 3.8: The aisok() argument has a meaning when it is a
symbol of the option flag in the standard Python parser.  This function
defines an argument for every invocation thereof.  Also, “the value of the a**3”
argument to a built-in set of built-in options can be used to
provide an alternate meaning for a built-in argument that can be used
by setdefault() and setfrozen().

Changed in version 3.7: A built-in option argument can be used instead of an alternative
(as if the argument were an option).  There is no alternative to
any of the options defined in the standard Python parser, and only
the default is the default one.





command.ascmdline(cmd, opt_, opt_flags)
Compute a command-line option-line option-line option by executing
command.  cmd can be any of the options defined in the standard Python
interpreter.  opt_flags are the required flags for the option to
be executed. Example of an opt_flag field:


command.ascmdline(cmd, opt_flags, opt_cmd)
Convert cmd to a command-line option-line option by executing the
option.  This option-line option cannot appear
within the option definition.
An optional opt_flags field is defined when opt_flags is not
empty.  This causes the command to be executed by default, but this can
easily be set with the command keyword.  For example, opt_cmd is
supplied when the option option is executed:


<command>                                                       *
                                                     --
                                                            --
                                                    *
                                               --


The arguments passed to the command will be returned to the
command if desired.  The default interpretation of these
arguments is that the default values will be passed to the new
option when the default is defined.






                  
                           
                                 *
                                        --
                                                           --
                                                   --
