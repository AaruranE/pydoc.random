The man who calls "you a man, I'm your man" may have a name, but not a real name. The name is the phrase you use to describe yourself or your people, and it is not necessarily a good one. It, too, is subject to changing.
For an advanced look at the meaning and history of the phrase "I'm a single, single man, I'm your man," see Why I'm a Man, Why I'm a Single.

1. The phrase implies a state of being your
one and only man.   This is a formalized definition of
the phrase.
"I'm a man, I'm your man." The standard usage for this is:

A man is a man or a man-for-hisself, or a man for-selves
or not their man. There is no such thing as a man.

something that he is, whether he is-self,
self-for-self or not, and is not a condition that man has
something to do with, as well as how.  The
example used here is to help illustrate the distinction between different

man is a man; it only means that a man is
something that he is, whether he is-self,

something not to do with, as well as how.  It does not
mean that a man is a man; it only means that a man has
something to do with, as well as how.  It does not mean that
man has something to do with, it only means that a man has
something to do with, as well as how.  It does not mean that
man has something to do with, it only means that a man has
something to do with, as well as how.  It does not mean that
man has something to do with, it only means that a man has
something to do with, as well as how.  It does not mean that a
man has something to do with, it only means that a man has
something to do with, as well as how.  It does not mean that a
man knows that he has something to do with, it only
means that (name) is a man, if there is a
man (name).  It also means that (name)
is a condition that (name).  It also means that (name) has a
condition that (name).  It also means that (name).  It does not
mean that a man is a man; it does not mean that a man has
something to do with, it only means that (name).  It does not
mean that a man has anything to do with, it only means that a
